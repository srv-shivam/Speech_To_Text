# Speech_To_Text
A simple speech to text recognition app
I have made this app using SpeechRecognizer class.
Used a basic UI.

// Problem
I am getting a problem, while the user tap on the mic and doesnot speak in that case the animation which I have used for the mic gets failed.
All suggestions are welcomed.
